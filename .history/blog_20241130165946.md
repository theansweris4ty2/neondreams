# Well it was an interesting experiment.

On November 2, 2024 we were all reminded that "We the People" includes a massive number of racist, misogynistic, anti-science troglodytes. In fact, if you choose to disregard the effects of voter suppression, those torch carrying villages make up the majority of the "People". 

On the bright side, now we get to watch the social scientist put on their lab coats and form "a more perfect union." However, instead of Franklin, Jefferson, and Adams, we are gifted with luminaries like Trump, Vance, and Gaetz.

-   1. The Executive Branch

### That way if one branch of the government abused its power the other two branches would be there to save the day. What could go wrong? I mean there is no way that the system could be subverted so that all the power would rest in the hands of a few bigoted, degenerate, power hungry plutocrats, right?

### Lets examine, shall we? We can always count on our 'commander-in chief'

### eh... maybe not.

### Well that is ok because we can count on the legislature to represent our best interests.
